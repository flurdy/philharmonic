# Philharmonic

### Microservices orchestration

Philharmonic lets you orchestrate a collection of microservices.


### Core concepts

* Microservices running inside Docker containers (In beta)
* Remote hosts support including cloud suppliers (Planned)
* Service dependencies to start full stack of services (In dev)
* Dynamic ports for independent staging, ideal for integration testing (Planned)


### Suite of Services

* Conductor - Akka based application to find, start and stop microservices (In beta)
* Notesheet - Service configurations with stub and stack support (In dev)
* Gantry - Docker API interaction (Currently part of Conductor)
* Phil - Simple CLI shell that interacts with Conductor (Planned)
* Melody - Service discovery (Planned)
